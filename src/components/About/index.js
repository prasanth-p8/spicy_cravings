            How to run a cloud kitchen business with delivery apps
          </h1>
          <p className="about-section-description live-desc">
            In this live session, we explained how to run a cloud kitchen from
            scratch to an intermediate level. We covered topics such as applying
            for licenses, sourcing raw materials, reducing costs efficiently
            when starting your business, delivery partner app deductions, and
            approximate income and expenses in this business. We also addressed
            some commonly asked questions. We hope this live session has cleared
            some of your doubts. Feel free to reach out to us via WhatsApp,
            Instagram, or email for any queries. Your suggestions and feedback
            are always welcome.
